= Eclipse Vert.x on Eclipse Che

This project is a very simple example of Vert.x application that you can develop and run in Eclipse Che using a Vert
.x stack (located in `stacks/vertx-stack.json`).


Once you have installed the stack in Che, create a black project and clone this repository. You can build the project
 using the `build` command and run it using the `run` command.


== Watch mode

You can also add another `watch` command with the following configuration:

* New custom command
* Command line:

```
mvn compile dependency:copy-dependencies  && java -cp  $(echo target/dependency/*.jar | tr ' ' ':'):"target/classes" &&
  io.vertx.core.Launcher run io.vertx.starter.MainVerticle --redeploy="src/main/**/*" --on-redeploy="mvn compile" --launcher-class=io.vertx.core.Launcher
```

The redeployment happen every time Che saves a file in  `src/main`. Be aware that if you change the main verticle you
 need to reconfigure the command.
